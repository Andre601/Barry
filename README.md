/Links/
Used for the =links <plugin/service> command.
Got a plugin you want to add? Feel free to submut a pull request.

**Example Template:**
`pluginname.json`
```
{
    "Description": "Awesome plugin!",
    "img": "https://link.to.the.img.png",
    "Words": "Need more words? Just type them",
    "Spigot": "https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/"
}
```

Just need to follow the JSON format seen in the other plugins.
  - 'img' needs to be lowercase if you wish to use it. (Shows in the top left of the embed)
  - file names should be in lowercase and end in .json
  - All links need to either start with https:// or http:// for Barry to pickup
  - You can have any amount links and information, but try to only put the useful ones in.
  
Once your request is pulled a staff member will need to run an update command to get any changes made. :)
